      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi I'm Tuncer,<br> I'm glad you managed to land on my personal website. 
        <br> This is my first website that I have programmed on my own. 
        <br> Let me tell you a little bit about me, you already know my name, 
        <br>I am 27 years old and I like to spend my free time with new technologies, psychology, neurology and coding. 
        <br> Did you know that music boosts your brain power? Scientists have found that the brain learns better when it is stimulated with sounds while learning. However, this is only true when there is a steady background of sound. This creates a working environment that promotes concentration without distracting.
        <br> Well, there's not much more to say right now, maybe this post will fill up soon.
        <p>Here's one of my favorite quotes:</p>
        <blockquote>
          "Real change requires you to change your behavior-not just your attitude."
          - Phil Stutz, The Tools: Transform Your Problems into Courage, Confidence, and Creativity.
